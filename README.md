A Mobile Cloud Application Template
====================

This project contains a template for a mobile cloud application that has a Spring Boot server, 
an Android client, and shared client/server code. The template includes appropriate testing for 
each part of the mobile cloud application.

## Key Information

Released: 10-7-14

Due Date: 10-7-14

Close Time: 12:25

Total Groups: 6

Requires Group Completion: Yes

## Part 1 - Group Setup

For the first part of the exercise, you should read this guide to using the mobile cloud project template
and then setup a development environment for each group member. You should complete this task as a group.
Team members should help each other get setup. 

When you are done with your setup, you should be able to:

0. Clone the Mobile Cloud application template from https://github.com/cs27x/mobilecloud-template.git
1. Run the server application from Eclipse
2. Run the JUnit tests in the server project and have them pass
3. Run the JUnit tests in the Common project and have them pass
4. Run the Android application in Genymotion and get to the list of videos
5. Run the Android tests in the AndroidStudio and view the results

When every team member is setup and can perform the steps above, call an instructor over to verify that
your group has completed this step.


## Part 2 - Applicaton Extension

For the second step, your group should design and implement a simple extension to the project and commit
it to a groupX_extension branch in the repo. DO NOT commit and push to master! If you do, your group is responsible
for fixing it. 

What are some possible extensions?
- Add a list of actors to the client
- Create a form to add a new movie from the client


## Part 3 - Adding Likes

"As a movie fan, I want to be able to express my enthusiasm for a video so that other people are aware of how great the video is."

For the final part of the exercise, your team will implement the ability to "like" a video. This change will require end-to-end updates in the code base. However, each individual change is relatively simple. Your team should divide up the work below and complete it. Each team member should have at least 1 commit that accomplishes an item on the list below:

- Adding a "like" count to each video:
   1. Create the data model
   		1. Copy the Video class and rename it Like. 
   		2. Remove all unneeded member variables from Like
   		3. Add a member variable called "videoId" of type Long
   		4. Add appropriate testing
   		5. Commit / push these changes to a the new feature branch
   3. Create the repository
   		1. Pull the groupX/datamodel branch
   		2. Create a new groupX/repository branch that includes the new data model
   		3. Copy the VideoRepository class and rename it LikeRepository
   		4. Change the generic parameters to <Like,Long>
   		5. Change the RepositoryRestResource path to path = "like"
   		6. Add a "findByVideoId" method that takes a long as a parameter and has the 
   		   parameter annotated wtih @Param("videoId") 
                7. Add appropriate testing
   4. Update the client API
                1. Pull the data model feature branch
                2. Add the method: public Collection<Video> findLikesForVideo(@Query("videoId") long videoId);
   		   parameter annotated wtih @Param("videoId") 
                3. Add appropriate testing
   5. Update the Android app to display the total likes (the hardest part)
                1. Update the anonymous inner class' call method in VideoListActivity.refreshVideos()
                   to use your new method on the client API to fetch the list of likes for each video
                   and append the total count to each video's name in the nested success() method.
                2. Add appropriate testing
   6. Make sure that all of your changes are merged/committed/pushed to your groupX_extension branch
   7. Demo your completed application and test to the instructor
   8. Stretch goal: add a "like" button to each video


Project Anatomy
---------------

The project template contains 3 sub-projects:

  - _Client_: contains a Gradle-based Android Studio app
  - _Server_: contains a Spring Boot REST-based back-end for the mobile app
  - _Common_: contains a Gradle-based Java project that is shared by both the Client and Server 
              projects and automatically included in both builds

Required Development Tools
------------------------------
1. Git (command line)
2. Android Studio
2. Eclipse
3. Genymotion Android Emulator (http://www.genymotion.com/)

Install all of the above software. After installing the software, make sure that you:

1. Open Android Studio, select the "SDK Manager" (right-hand side of the top menu bar) and 
   download the Android 4.3 and 4.4 SDK tools
2. Open Genymotion, click Add, and then select an emulator, such as a Nexus 5 device.
3. Select the emulator in Genymotion and hit play. If you see an error, read this link
   to resolve it (and call me over to get help)

The Client Project
-------------------

###Setup

  1. Download and install the latest version of Android Studio
  2. Clone this repository
  3. In Android Studio, File->Import Project
  4. Select the Client directory and then OK
  5. Click the play button to launch the application in the Android emulator
  
The client contains a basic app for viewing a list of metadata for videos stored on the server. The
client uses the Square Retrofit library (http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to send HTTP requests to
the server to interact with the REST resources. Currently, the client simply displays a list of the
videos that are stored on the server. 

###Code Overview

The client has two activities: LoginScreenActivity and VideoListActivity. The LoginScreenActivity
accepts a username and password (which aren't used in this example) and a server address. When
the user logs in with this information, the LoginScreenActivity attempts to retrieve a list of 
videos from the server over HTTP. If the videos are successfully retrieved, the LoginScreenActivity
opens the VideoListActivity.

The VideoListActivity uses a simple ListView and an ArrayAdapter of Strings to display the names
of the videos that are retrieved from the server. This class shows one of the simplest possible
list-based screens that you can build that fetches data from a server. 

The VideoSvc class is responsible for creating an HTTP client that can interact with the server
to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) videos. The VideoSvc is built on top of Retrofit.
Retrofit is a library that allows you to create objects that automatically translate method calls
into HTTP requests on a remote server. Retrofit provides a strong type-safe interface to HTTP-based
interactions and vastly simplifies client-server interaction over HTTP. To use Retrofit, you first
create a Java interface describing the server-side services that you want to interact with:

```java

public interface VideoSvcApi {
	
	@GET("/video")
	public Collection<Video> getVideoList();

}

```
This interface is a standard Java interface that has a single method that you expect to be supported by
the server to retrieve the list of videos. The method is annotated with the "@GET" annotation, which 
tells Retrofit that calls to this method should be translated into HTTP GET request to the "/video" path 
on the server. Retrofit dynamically creates objects that implement these types of interfaces and provides
all of the plumbing to translate your method calls to the interface's methods into HTTP requests to the
appropriate endpoints. Retrofit also handles marshalling Objects to/from JSON. In the example above,
Retrofit will attempt to automatically read the JSON that it receives from the server and unmarshall it
into a Collection of Video objects (Retrofit uses the same library that you used in the Git branching
exercise).

In order to use Retrofit, you have to instruct it to dynamically create an object that implements your
interface. You can create these dynamic object as shown below:

```java
VideoSvcApi svc = new RestAdapter.Builder()
				.setEndpoint("http://someserver.com").setLogLevel(LogLevel.FULL).build()
				.create(VideoSvcApi.class);
				
Collection<Video> videos = svc.getVideoList();
```
The RestAdapter.Builder() creates the dynamic object implementation of the VideoSvcApi and returns it.
Once you have one of these objects, you can call methods on it like any other Java object, as shown above
in the call to svc.getVideoList().

LoginScreenActivity and VideoListActivity both use the VideoSvc to construct a VideoSvcApi implementation 
using Retrofit and retrieve videos from the server. One important consideration on mobile devices is that
you do not want to do networking interactions, such as HTTP requests, on the thread that is rendering the
UI of an application. Since the calls to the methods on VideoSvcApi all result in HTTP requests being sent
over the network to a server, all of these method calls need to take place in background threads. 

The CallableTask class provides a simple interface for executing arbitrary work in a background thread and
then notifying a callback of the success or failure of the background work in the UI thread. The reason that
the CallableTask notifies the callback in the UI thread is that only the UI thread can make changes to the
user interface elements. Using the CallableTask, networking operations can be run in the background and the
results of those operations can be communicated to the user via changes to the GUI made by the callback
object.

###Testing

The Client template project is configured to use the Android JUnit-based testing framework. All of the test
code is contained within the androidTest folder. Each class in the client application has an associated
Android test. There are two different types of tests in the project:

1. _Standard TestCase_ classes are used to test code that does not depend on an Activity or other Android
   UI classes (these classes extend TestCase).

2. _ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2_ classes are used to test Activities.

Take a look at each type of test to understand how they work. All of these tests interact with the real server
and require that it is running before they are launched. Since these tests do not isolate small pieces of
functionality, they are actually _integration tests_. Normally, it is best to write small and fast unit tests
that isolate functionality and are simple to run. However, Android tests run so incredibly slowly, you might
as well do integration testing with the actual server as it adds very little extra time.

_How do I run a test?_ Android requires an emulator or real device in order to run tests. Start an emulator or
connect an Android device via USB. When you want to run one of the tests, right-click on it->Run XYZTest. Android
Studio will load the test into your emulator or device, execute it, and then display the results in the pane
at the bottom of Android Studio.

_How do I add a new test?_ First, determine which of the two types of tests listed above seems most appropriate.
After you decide on the right type of test, copy/paste one of the existing tests into same package (or another
one in the androidTest folder) and rename the test appropriately by right-clicking on it, Refactor->Rename.
You can then add / delete / modify the test as needed. Since Android does not use the latest version of JUnit,
you must name each of your test methods testXYZ. There are no @Test annotations. 

The Common Project
-------------------
###Setup

  1. Download and install the latest version of Eclipse or Intellij
  2. Import the Common project as a Gradle project

###Code Overview

The Common project contains classes that are shared by both the client and server. Rather than duplicating this 
shared code, the Common project is included in the builds for both of the other projects. Any code that you put
into the Common project will be available to the client and server. 

The Common project contains the "domain objects" or "model objects" that are used by the application. In this case,
a Video object is used to represent video metadata. The Video class has simple member variables for different types
of video metadata, such as the name and duration of the Video. The Video class also has special annotations that
are used by the Server and discussed below.

The VideoSvcApi is defined in the Common project. The interface contains the methods and Retrofit annotations that
are used to build the client object that communicates with the server. Finally, the TestUtils class provides some
helper methods for creating dummy Videos.

###Testing

There is little to test in this project, however, there are still tests included for each object. The project
uses JUnit and the OpenPojo framework for testing. The VideoTest checks that the custom code in the equals()
and hashcode() methods of the Video object works properly. 

A common question is whether or not it makes sense to test getters/setters on objects. Manually creating tests
of every getter/setter is time consuming. The PojoTest uses the OpenPojo framework to automatically discover every
Plain Old Java Object (POJO) class in your application and test it. A POJO is just an object that is essentially
all member variables and getters/setters (e.g., model objects). The PojoTest finds every one of these objects,
tests that their getters/setters work properly, and also runs a number of other code structure tests against them.
This tool saves you a vast amount of test implementation work while increasing your test coverage.

_How do I run a test?_ All you need to do is right-click on the test, Run As->JUnit Test.

_How do I add a test?_ Select the package that you want to add the test to (it must be beneath src/test) and
then File->New->JUnit Test Case. Add one or more methods annotated with @Test.

The Server Project
-------------------

###Setup

   1. Download and install the latest version of Eclipse or Intellij
   2. Import the Server project as a Gradle project
  
###Code Overview

The server-side of the application provides a simple REST-based service to store metadata relating to videos.
The server uses Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to allow you to persist data. In this case, the server is 
providing a REST-based interface to persist instances of the Video class into a database.

There is very little code in the server. Most of the work is done by Spring Boot and Spring Data Rest. These 
frameworks automaticaly setup a web server, database, and all of the REST infrastructure to create, read,
update, and delete Video objects using a REST-based interface. An in-depth tutorial of Spring Data Rest and
how this works is available here: http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest/. We will go into these
frameworks in detail later in the course.

###How to Run the Server
Right-click on the Application class->Run As->Java Application. When the server finishes launching, you should be able
to open your browser to http://localhost:8080/video to see an empty list of videos.

###How the Server Stores Data
The server uses a standard, called Java Persistence API (JPA), to store objects. Any Java object can be annotated
with special JPA annotations and automatically persisted to a database. JPA stores the state of the object, including
all of its member variable values to a database. When you retrieve the object, JPA automatically extracts the
object's state and member variable values from the database and sets their values. In this example, instances of
the Video object are persisted in a database on the server with JPA:

```java
@Entity
public class Video {
	
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
	private long id = -1;

	private String name;
	private String url;
	private long duration;
	..
}
```

The @Entity annotation tells JPA that you want to be able to store these objects in the database. The @Id annotation
tells JPA what member variable should be used to uniquely identify each instance of the Video class. Finally, all
of the member variable values (e.g., name, url, duration) are saved in the database when JPA stores a Video object.

When you launch the server, Spring Boot automatically starts a database (which only persists data to memory in the
current configuration), a web server, and a Java-based servlet framework for handling requests. Spring Boot looks
for all of the classes that extend CrudRepository and then automatically creates implementations of them that
can receive HTTP requests to peform CRUD operations on their associated object types. 

```java
@RepositoryRestResource(path = "/video")
public interface VideoRepository extends CrudRepository<Video, Long>{
     //  no methods necessary
}
```
In the simple example above, the VideoRepository is declared as a CrudRepository that stores Video objects. Each
Video object has a Long as its unique key (the second generic parameterization). The @RepositoryRestResource(path = "/video")
annotation tells Spring that you want to create a REST interface that can receive requests at the "/video" path and
automatically create/delete, etc. Video objects. Based on this interface and annotation, Spring creates a series of 
HTTP request paths on your server for:

_GET /video_ 
   - returns the list of all videos stored on the server

_GET /video/{id}_
   - Returns the JSON for the video with the given id (e.g., /video/123)
   
_POST /video_ 
   - add a video to the server
   - takes a video object as an application/json body in the request

_DELETE /video/{id}_
   - delete the video with the given id 

_PUT /video/{id}_
   - replace the video with the given id using the JSON provided in the body of the request

_etc._...

_How do I store new types of objects on the server?_ Let's say that you wanted to store comments for each video. You
would first create a class to store the comment data with the appropriate JPA annotations, like this:

```java
@Entity
public class Video {
	
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
	private long id = -1;

	private String userThatPostedTheComment;
	private String commentText;
	private long creationTime;
	..
}
```
The next step would be to create the REST interface on the server to perform CRUD operations on the comments. To create
this REST interface, you would simply create a new repostiory interface like this:

```java
@RepositoryRestResource(path = "/comment")
public interface CommentRepository extends CrudRepository<Comment, Long>{
     //  no methods necessary
}
```
That's it. You would have created all of the code to then have the following REST paths on the server:

  - GET /comment
  - GET /comment/{id}
  - POST /comment
  - PUT /comment/{id}
  - DELETE /comment/{id}
  - etc..

How would you interact with this new comment service from the client? To do that, you would just need to add
some additional methods to the VideoSvcApi (or a new interface for commenting) like this:

```java

public interface VideoSvcApi {
	
	@GET("/video")
	public Collection<Video> getVideoList();
	
	@GET("/comment")
	public Collection<Comment> getAllComments();
	
	@POST("/comment")
	public Void addComment(@Body Comment c);
}

```

Once you did that, you could post a comment like this from your Android client:

```java
VideoSvcApi svc = new RestAdapter.Builder()
				.setEndpoint("http://someserver.com").setLogLevel(LogLevel.FULL).build()
				.create(VideoSvcApi.class);
				
Comment comment = new Comment();
comment.setUserThatPostedTheComment("Jill Smith");
comment.setCommentText("This movie was great");

svc.addComment(comment);
```
Using the code above that would be running on your Android client, Retrofit would convert your Comment object to JSON,
put that JSON into the body of an HTTP POST request, and send the HTTP request to the server. The server would receive
the request, unmarshall the Comment object from the JSON in the request body, store the Comment object in the database,
and then let the client know that the request succeeded.

###Testing

There is very little actual code in the server. What code is there is primarily interfaces or boilerplate configuration
code. The server has a single JUnit test that checks that the server correctly implements all of the HTTP REST methods
that we expect in order to support the VideoSvcApi. The VideoSvcClientApiTest is the only test and is simple JUnit
test. You add/run tests in this project identically to the Common project.


The gitingore file
-------------------
This repo is setup with a .gitignore file. This file automatically ignores all IDE settings, build artifacts, etc.
that shouldn't be committed to the source repository. See the .gitignore file in the root of the repository for
a list of the types of files and directories that are ignored.
